Behold a Pale Horse:

Ideas:
- The game is set in a kind of purgatory.
- There are underlying dark religious themes, especially relating to judgement, the madness of god, the nature of mankind.
- The game is a continuous climb in power. You build up a gang of outlaws.
- There are competitions between different gangs in the west?
- You can offer sacrifices to some kind of twisted god? You can sacrifice different things in exchange for others, e.g. your outlaws?
- The objective is to defeat the pale rider? Some kind of mythic entity who roams the desert?
- The objective is to rule the wastes.
- Escape the horrid loop of existence.
- You're being hunted by a supernatural force - The Pale Rider?
- Time is progressively moving towards nightfall? Or there is an actual day/night cycle?

Gameplay-focused:
- Survive for as long as possible?
- The Pale Rider roams the west at night?

Weapons/Items:
- Different types of weapons, ideally you take them from other fighters (symbolic).
- You could offer misc. items to the rider?
